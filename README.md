#Creating a Simple Webmap using Leaflet

##Introduction
###What is Leaflet?

###How can Leaflet be useful to me?


##Tutorial
###Before we start...
You will need:
1. A code editor, I used Atom
2. Set up a local web server. I used [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/mac/).

In this local web server, we will be storing all the files we need to for this tutorial. Using MAMP, I stored all my files in the applications `htdocs` folder. [Check out this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0CPgBrjpl8&feature=emb_logo) to learn how to set up and store files in MAMP.
